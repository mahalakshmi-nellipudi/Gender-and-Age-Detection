# Gender-and-Age-Detection
The Gender and Age Detection mini project is a computer vision-based application that uses machine learning to predict the gender (male/female) and age group (such as 0-2, 4-6, 8-12, 15-20, 25-32, etc.) of a person from a facial image. The system leverages pre-trained deep learning models and OpenCV for face detection, allowing real-time prediction from webcam input or static images.

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in real-world applications like surveillance systems, targeted marketing, or interactive kiosks that personalize content based on user demographics.
